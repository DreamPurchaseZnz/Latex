# LaTeX/Modular Documents

Create a clear structure of the whole project this way:

1. create a directory only for the project. We'll refer to that in the following parts as the root directory

2. create two other directories inside the root, one for LaTeX documents, the other one for images. 
Since you'll have to write their name quite often, choose short names. A suggestion would be simply tex and img.
3. create your document (we'll call it document.tex, 
but you can use the name you prefer) and your own package (for example mystyle.sty); 
this second file will help you keep the code cleaner.

```
./document.tex
./mystyle.sty
./tex/
./img/
```
